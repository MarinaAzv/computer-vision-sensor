 Computer vision sensor for safe vehicle driving with Python, OpenCV and TensoFlow

This computer vision project uses Python, OpenCV and TensorFlow to identify objects and people.
The project was developed combining Deep Learning models with TensorFlow to perform the following detections while driving a vehicle:

Drowsiness (tiredness, yawning, closed eyes);
Recklessness (using a cell phone, not wearing a seat belt, smoking, hands off the steering wheel while driving);
Graphical analysis of eye opening rate in order to predict drowsiness;
Use of EPI's (if necessary);
Driver facial recognition;
Report of infractions and imprudence detected while driving;

The project idea aims to be an alternative proposal, more complete and efficient to the current drowsiness detection systems while driving, specially designed for use in passenger vehicles. The script and data are processed in a desktop application.

This project was presented as a technical proposal to Renault and the project is currently in the prototype development phase
